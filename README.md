# SGProgrammingTest
The answer to the first problem in the Scientific Games programming test.  This application targets Windows only and cannot run on other operating systems. 
The dataset is randomized on every execution.

# How to Use
---
You can run the program by cloning the project, going into the Builds folder and executing the program from there.
If you'd like to generate you're own output file, open the command line in the builds folder and run the following command...
```
SGProgrammingTest.exe > output.txt
```
That will run the application and create a file in the same folder called "output.txt".

# Example Output
